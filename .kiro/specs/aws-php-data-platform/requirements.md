# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves re-architecting a PHP-based application with MySQL database on AWS to create a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure. The system will leverage Aurora Serverless, EC2 Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer (ALB), Security Groups, Secrets Manager, and private subnets to enable automated, fault-tolerant data ingestion and processing across multiple Availability Zones.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a scalable PHP application infrastructure on AWS, so that the system can automatically handle varying loads without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale EC2 instances using Auto Scaling Groups
2. WHEN traffic decreases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale down EC2 instances to reduce costs
3. WHEN an instance fails THEN the system SHALL automatically replace it within 5 minutes
4. IF load exceeds 80% CPU utilization THEN the system SHALL trigger scaling events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want Aurora Serverless for database management, so that database resources scale automatically based on demand without manual provisioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database load increases THEN Aurora Serverless SHALL automatically scale compute capacity
2. WHEN database is idle THEN Aurora Serverless SHALL scale down to minimize costs
3. WHEN connection limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle connection pooling gracefully
4. IF database fails THEN Aurora Serverless SHALL automatically failover to another AZ within 60 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all infrastructure components secured with proper network isolation, so that sensitive data and applications are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying resources THEN all application servers SHALL be placed in private subnets
2. WHEN accessing the database THEN connections SHALL only be allowed from application servers
3. WHEN storing sensitive configuration THEN credentials SHALL be managed through AWS Secrets Manager
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN Security Groups SHALL block the connection
5. WHEN data is transmitted THEN all communication SHALL use encrypted connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated data ingestion and processing capabilities, so that the system can handle data workflows without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger processing workflows
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN data processing completes THEN the system SHALL log success metrics
4. IF processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and store error details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want high availability across multiple Availability Zones, so that the system remains operational even during infrastructure failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN resources SHALL be distributed across at least 2 AZs
2. WHEN one AZ fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating from remaining AZs
3. WHEN load balancer detects unhealthy instances THEN traffic SHALL be routed to healthy instances
4. IF entire AZ becomes unavailable THEN system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost manager, I want cost-efficient resource utilization, so that infrastructure costs are optimized while maintaining performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are underutilized THEN the system SHALL automatically scale down
2. WHEN using Aurora Serverless THEN database costs SHALL only accrue during active usage
3. WHEN instances are idle THEN Auto Scaling SHALL terminate unnecessary instances
4. IF cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send cost alerts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper load balancing and traffic distribution, so that user requests are efficiently handled across all available instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN ALB SHALL distribute traffic across healthy instances
2. WHEN an instance becomes unhealthy THEN ALB SHALL stop routing traffic to it
3. WHEN SSL termination is required THEN ALB SHALL handle HTTPS connections
4. IF sticky sessions are needed THEN ALB SHALL support session affinity
